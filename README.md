# PyPlot_orientedmap
The Python package for plotting planar and toroidal maps.

The installation is done first by building some environment. This can be done for example by:
```sh
python3 -m venv $HOME/my_environment
source $HOME/my_environment/bin/activate
```

Then the installation is done in the following way:
```sh
pip3 install git+https://github.com/MathieuDutSik/PyPlot_orientedmap
```
which will compile the C++ binaries of polyhedral and install them.
